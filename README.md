## WHAT?

I wondered, is there a way to make the gadget time more meaningful, useful and the same time interesting.

## WHY?

Motherhood is a God's Gift. But it’s always challenging to balance between work and life. When it comes to our kids who make our life meaningful, It won’t feel good to often see them playing with mobile and tablets. And I personally believe the addictive games like Angry Birds, Temple Run etc. are not going to help them in any way.
Even we tried few learning games but they make them bored soon.

## HOW?

I created a match game (Which my kid loves to solve) with my relative’s images. And added information for the right selection and clues for the wrong one like “You selected a niece, check for a niece in the right side”
Oh my God...We can't buy that happiness and smile on my kids face. It’s thousand times more compared to him playing gadget games. He found it more interesting to see the images of his knowns and match Uncle with Aunt, Grandma with Grandpa.... And added information for the right selection and clues for the wrong one like “You selected a niece, check for a niece in the right side”.
And I am more than happy and satisfied because I get the feel that I can contribute to the time he spent on gadget and don’t forget, he is learning.
But how to make this scalable? The result is this idea to create a platform to create and customize our own games. This game creator has Match, Memory game, Odd one out and Flip games as POC and we can add more and more to it. 
You can create infinity games under each category by your own imagination and creativity and more important "What you feel the best for you kid"

# !!!Happy Woman's Day and a pleasant Motherhood!!!
